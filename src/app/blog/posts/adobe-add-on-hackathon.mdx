This post documents our journey of building **Loomis**, an AI-powered Adobe Express add-on — what problem we were solving, how we approached it, what worked, what didn’t, and what we learned along the way.

The goal was simple:
Make design feel fluid by keeping inspiration inside the canvas.\_

## The Problem

In modern design workflows, creativity is constantly interrupted.

While working on presentations, social posts, or business documents, we kept seeing the same pattern:

- Designers weren’t stuck on ideas — they were stuck on **finding the right assets**.
- People kept jumping between:

  - Unsplash
  - Tenor
  - Adobe Stock
  - Pinterest

- Every switch broke focus, slowed momentum, and made design feel fragmented.

So even though tools like Adobe Express were powerful, the **experience of finding assets felt broken**.

---

## Design Goals

Before writing code, we defined clear goals for Loomis:

1. Keep everything **inside the Adobe Express canvas**
2. Reduce manual searching for visuals
3. Make AI suggestions **relevant, not random**
4. Ensure the add-on felt **native, not like a third-party plugin**
5. Ship a real, usable product — not just a demo

These goals pushed us toward a vision-first, context-aware system rather than a simple keyword-based search tool.

---

## The Core Idea

What if your design tool could **actually understand your canvas** and proactively suggest what it needs next?

Instead of you thinking:

> “What image should I add?”

Loomis would think:

> “This slide looks like a minimal tech pitch — maybe you need a subtle gradient background and a conceptual illustration.”

That became the foundation of Loomis.

---

## What Loomis Does

Loomis is an **AI-powered Adobe Express add-on** that works directly inside your canvas. It:

- Scans your current design (or an uploaded image)
- Understands the theme, style, and intent
- Identifies what you already have — and what might be missing
- Suggests relevant:

  - Images
  - Backgrounds
  - Illustrations
  - GIFs

- Lets you insert any suggestion into your design **in one click**

No tabs. No distractions. Just design.

---

## How We Built It

We built Loomis as a **native Adobe Express add-on**, using:

- **Lit + Spectrum Web Components** for a polished UI
- **Adobe Express SDK** to read and modify the canvas
- **Google Gemini Vision** for AI-powered design analysis
- An **Asset Orchestrator** that:

  - Fetches GIFs from **Tenor**
  - Fetches images, backgrounds, and illustrations from **Unsplash**
  - Handles attribution and Adobe constraints automatically

This modular architecture let us iterate quickly while keeping the system reliable.

## The Hard Parts (and How We Solved Them)

We didn’t just ship a demo — we shipped a **usable product**. Along the way, we tackled:

- Making AI suggestions **consistent and structured** instead of vague
- Ensuring GIFs met **Adobe’s animation requirements**
- Balancing **speed vs. accuracy** in AI analysis
- Designing a UI with:

  - Proper loading states
  - Graceful error handling
  - Smooth pagination

Each of these forced us to think beyond just “make it work” and toward “make it feel good.”

## What We’re Proud Of

Loomis isn’t just a concept — it’s real. We:

- Delivered a **fully working MVP inside Adobe Express**
- Built **true canvas-aware AI analysis**
- Enabled **genuine one-click asset insertion**
- Created **explainable, segmented suggestions** (not random results)
- Designed a UI that feels **native to Adobe Express**
- Made the add-on easily deployable via a **private link**

---

## What We Learned

Building Loomis taught us a lot:

- AI works best when you give it **clear structure and constraints**
- More options ≠ better creativity
- **Smart filtering beats endless scrolling**
- Shipping fast with quality matters more than chasing perfection

---

Loomis is our attempt to make design **faster, smarter, and more intuitive** — without leaving the canvas.
