## The problem with static project pages

Most project pages feel like brochureware: a list of links, screenshots, and maybe a PDF. They don’t invite interaction, they don’t scale for collaboration, and they rarely evolve once published.

When I built **Next ProjectSpace**, the goal was simple: **turn static project listings into a living platform** where creators can showcase work and a community can discuss, improve, and evolve ideas.

---

## The stack that made it practical

### Next.js (App Router) — the foundation

Next.js provided structure more than just rendering:

- **Server components** for fast initial loads and SEO
- **Nested layouts** to separate public pages from authenticated dashboards
- **Dynamic routes** for projects and community threads (`app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx`)

**Lesson:** Clear routing structure reduces both technical complexity and UX confusion.

---

### Supabase — auth, database, storage

Supabase unified the backend:

- Authentication (signup/login)
- PostgreSQL for projects, threads, and comments
- Storage for project media

Role rows and Row Level Security made it possible to ship safe defaults without complex backend code.

---

### UI stack

- **Tailwind CSS** for layout and consistency
- **shadcn/ui** for composable components
- **Framer Motion** for subtle interaction feedback

Animations are minimal and functional—focused on clarity, not decoration.

---

## Design decisions that mattered

### 1. Public showcase + authenticated workspace

The platform is split into two clear zones:

- **Public**: project listings, project pages, community discussions
- **Authenticated**: dashboard, content management, posting tools

This separation keeps the mental model simple for users and maintainable for developers.

---

### 2. Community-first project pages

Each project is treated as a shared space:

- Structured project content
- Inline discussion threads
- Simple interaction flows (read → comment → contribute)

Projects feel active rather than archived.

---

### 3. Minimal, purposeful motion

Motion is used only to support interaction:

- Card hover lift
- Modal transitions
- Navigation feedback

The goal is feedback, not visual noise.

---

## Performance practices

### Server-first rendering

Public content renders on the server for fast first paint and SEO.

### Selective hydration

Only interactive components (editors, forms, reactions) are client-side.

### Image optimization

Media is served through optimized pipelines using Next.js `<Image>` and Supabase Storage.

---

## Auth and routing architecture

The routing model follows a layered approach:

- **Middleware**: session sync and UX redirects
- **Server guards**: enforce authentication in protected routes
- **RLS**: database-level access control

This avoids auth flicker, prevents data leaks, and keeps the UI simple.

---

## Technical challenges solved

### Reliable demo infrastructure

To avoid free-tier database pauses, a lightweight server endpoint triggers periodic DB activity, keeping the demo environment stable without user traffic.

### Clean separation of concerns

Server components handle data and security, client components handle interaction and state.

### Scalable schema design

Projects, discussions, and comments follow simple relational models that scale without overengineering.

---

## What I’d improve next

- Add a lightweight CMS for non-technical editors
- Add search for projects and discussions
- Improve mobile-first layouts and flows

---

## Key takeaways

1. Platforms scale better than pages
2. Server-first architecture simplifies security
3. Performance and UX are inseparable
4. Reusability matters more than features
