## Overview

Loomis reimagines the creative workflow inside **Adobe Express** by bringing intelligence directly into the canvas. Instead of forcing designers to switch between multiple tools to find assets, Loomis **“sees” the design, understands its intent, and proactively suggests what it needs next.**

The system combines computer vision, contextual reasoning, and intelligent asset orchestration to deliver a seamless, native-feeling design assistant that keeps creativity uninterrupted.

Core capabilities include:

- **Canvas-Aware AI**: Understands theme, style, and context
- **Intent-Based Recommendations**: Surfaces only relevant visuals
- **One-Click Insertion**: Instantly applies assets inside Express
- **Constraint-Aware Retrieval**: Handles attribution and Adobe rules
- **Native UX**: Feels like a built-in feature, not a plugin

---

## What Loomis Does

Loomis operates directly within Adobe Express and performs the following:

1. **Scans the current canvas (or an uploaded image)**
2. **Analyzes visual and semantic context using AI**
3. **Identifies what exists — and what might be missing**
4. **Suggests:**

   - Images
   - Backgrounds
   - Illustrations
   - GIFs

5. Allows **one-click insertion** of any suggested asset into the design

This transforms asset discovery from a search problem into an **AI-driven design augmentation problem.**

---

## System Architecture

Loomis follows a modular, service-oriented architecture:

1. **UI Layer (Client)**

   - Built with **Lit + Spectrum Web Components**
   - Designed to match Adobe Express’ native look and feel
   - Handles loading states, pagination, and graceful error handling

2. **Canvas Interface Layer**

   - Uses **Adobe Express SDK**
   - Reads live canvas state
   - Modifies the canvas when assets are inserted

3. **Vision & Understanding Layer**

   - Powered by **Google Gemini Vision**
   - Extracts:

     - Theme (e.g., “minimal tech”, “vibrant travel”, “corporate”)
     - Visual style (color palette, composition, tone)
     - Content intent (marketing, storytelling, branding, etc.)

4. **Asset Orchestrator**

   - Acts as a smart intermediary between AI and asset providers
   - Retrieves assets from:

     - **Tenor** → GIFs
     - **Unsplash** → Images, illustrations, backgrounds

   - Ensures:

     - Proper attribution
     - Compliance with Adobe constraints
     - Format compatibility (especially for GIF animations)

5. **Recommendation Engine**

   - Filters raw AI outputs into structured, segmented suggestions
   - Avoids randomness by enforcing clear categories and relevance scoring

---

## Key Technical Challenges & Solutions

- **Inconsistent AI suggestions** → Introduced structured prompts + post-processing constraints
- **GIF compatibility issues** → Added validation layer for Adobe animation requirements
- **Slow AI analysis** → Optimized request batching and selective canvas scanning
- **UI latency** → Designed progressive loading and pagination
- **Attribution compliance** → Automated metadata handling in the Asset Orchestrator

---

## Accomplishments

Loomis is not a prototype — it is a **functional, deployable product** inside Adobe Express.

We successfully:

- Delivered a **fully working MVP inside Adobe Express**
- Implemented **true canvas scanning and AI reasoning**
- Enabled **real one-click asset insertion**
- Provided **clear, explainable, segmented suggestions**
- Built a **polished, native-feeling UI**
- Made deployment easy via a **private install link**

---

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** Lit, Spectrum Web Components
- **Adobe Platform:** Adobe Express SDK
- **AI / Vision:** Google Gemini Vision
- **Asset Sources:**

  - Tenor (GIFs)
  - Unsplash (Images, Illustrations, Backgrounds)

- **Languages:** JavaScript, HTML, CSS

---

## Impact

Loomis improves the design workflow by:

- Reducing tool switching
- Minimizing creative friction
- Accelerating design iteration
- Helping non-designers create professional visuals
- Keeping inspiration inside the canvas

This directly aligns with enterprise productivity goals: **better output, faster.**

---

## What We Learned

- AI works best with **clear structure and constraints**
- More choices can slow designers down — **smart filtering matters**
- UX is as important as AI — perception of speed is critical
- Shipping a reliable product under tight deadlines is a real skill
