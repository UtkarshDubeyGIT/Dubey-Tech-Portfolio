## Overview

Development of a reusable project showcase and community platform using Next.js, designed as a flexible template for teams and client-facing applications.

The platform provides a structured way to publish projects, manage content, and enable community discussions, while maintaining a clear separation between public pages and authenticated dashboards.

## Key Features

- **Project Showcase System**: Built modular project listing and detail views using Next.js and React, enabling teams to publish and organize projects with media, descriptions, and metadata.
- **Community Discussions**: Implemented discussion threads and comments to allow users to engage around projects, turning static pages into collaborative spaces.
- **Authentication and Roles**: Integrated Supabase Auth with role-based access to support authenticated dashboards and basic admin workflows.
- **Admin and Content Workflows**: Developed internal tools for managing projects and announcements, enabling controlled content updates without direct code changes.
- **Reusable Template Architecture**: Structured routing and layouts to support rapid reuse for similar platforms, with clear separation of public and authenticated areas.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router)**: For server-rendered pages, nested layouts, and dynamic routing.
- **Supabase**: For PostgreSQL database, authentication, and file storage.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For consistent, responsive UI styling.
- **shadcn/ui**: For composable UI components.
- **Framer Motion**: For subtle interaction and transition effects.
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting.

## Challenges and Learnings

A key challenge was designing routing and authentication flows that supported both public access and protected dashboards without introducing auth flicker or duplicated logic. This was solved by combining middleware, server-side route guards, and database-level access control.

Another learning was structuring the platform as a reusable template rather than a one-off site, which required keeping features modular and avoiding hardcoded, project-specific assumptions.

## Outcome

The platform serves as a reusable foundation for project and community-driven applications. It enables faster setup for similar use cases, provides a consistent structure for content and discussions, and supports scalable growth without major architectural changes.

It is now positioned as a flexible template for teams or clients who need a project showcase with built-in community features.
